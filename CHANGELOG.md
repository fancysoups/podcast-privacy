# Changelog

## [0.0.6] - 2020-11-01

### Added

- Merged data in from https://github.com/opawg/podcast-hosts. Thanks @jamescridland (https://github.com/fancysoups/podcast-privacy/issues/2)
- Added logos as CDN-served URLs.
- Added a DATA_OVERVIEW.md file with a table making it easier to find missing data to fill in.

### Changed

- "Dynamic Advertising" is now "Dynamic Audio". (This flag will not need to change again in the future, and we'll label new ones better from the start so they can remain constant.)

### Added

- Initial release.
